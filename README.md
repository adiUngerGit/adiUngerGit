### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### You've got my Git! how fun!
#
Here you can see some nice projects I have done in a variety of languages and techniques.

I like to participate in projects with a significant impact.
#
Therefore, I served as a head of the company QueenB Volunteer Application. 

An app that encourages young women to study software.
